### 🌟 Welcome to the VHI Data Analysis Lab 🌟

Welcome to the VHI Data Analysis Lab, where we dive into fascinating environmental data to explore, analyze, and visualize vegetation health! 🌱📊

### 🧑‍🔬 About This Project
This repository contains the data analysis pipeline for working with VHI (Vegetation Health Index) data. Our goal is to explore trends in vegetation health across different regions, process large datasets, and create insightful visualizations that help us understand how the environment is changing over time.

### 📂 Files Included
Here’s a quick look at the contents of this repo:

Data: The folder VHI_data contains the raw .txt files with VHI data for multiple regions.

Scripts: Python scripts to read, clean, and process the data. These scripts will allow you to convert raw data into structured datasets for analysis.

Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data exploration and visualizations. 📝✨

### ⚙️ How to Use This Repository
##### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, first, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/alinalinamala-collab/specprograming.git
cd lab1-vhi-data-analysis

##### 2. Install the Requirements

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

##### 3. Run the Scripts
Once everything is set up, you can run the data processing script. The main script is located in process_data.py, and it's designed to clean and process all the .txt files in the VHI_data folder.

python process_data.py

This will read the raw data, process it, and output a final dataset with all the processed information!

### 🐍 Python Dependencies

##### We use the following Python libraries in this project:

Pandas - (for data manipulation) 🐼

Glob - (for file path management) 🔍

OS - (for interacting with the file system) 💻

StringIO - (for handling data as strings) 📝

Install them all at once by running:

pip install pandas

### 📊 What You Can Do

Data Exploration: Dive into the .txt files to explore how vegetation health changes over time in different regions!

Visualizations: Use the Jupyter notebooks to create graphs and visual representations of the data 🌍📈.
